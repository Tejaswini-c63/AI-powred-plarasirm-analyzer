| **AI / NLP**        | Python text similarity algorithms (Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF, NLP-based comparison) |
| **Database**        | SQLite (default Django DB)                                                          |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub                                                                        |


How It Works

The user uploads one or more text files or enters text directly.

The system processes the input using AI-based similarity algorithms.

The backend computes the similarity score using methods like cosine similarity or token matching.

The result is displayed in the web interface, showing matched content and plagiarism percentage.
